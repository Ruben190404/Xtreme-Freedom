            <p> This is a wonderful trip across the North Sea that you could experience, the boat trip will last a
                midweek
                and makes a tour of the North Sea.<br>
                You will pass beautiful places such as Kingston upon Hull, Aberdeen, the island of Mainland, Stavanger
                and
                then back to Den Helder.<br>
                In the cities/places we pass by are markets and fun activities that you can do such as,
                Streetlife Museum of The Deep an aquarium which are near Kingston.<br>
                On Mainland 1 of Scotland's 790 islands, there are tours that take you past ancient ruins or you do
                just a walking tour.<br>
                In the Norwegian town of Stavanger we are going to catch our own fish at the Norwegian coast on the last
                day
                to cook it afterwards, you would be able to choose from salmon or arctic cod.<br>
                After eating the fresh fish we pack our things and leave again by boat to Den Helder.
