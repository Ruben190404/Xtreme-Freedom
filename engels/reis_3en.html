                <p>The first day is a chill day. You will have a nice breakfast with the rest of the travelers and get to know each other,
                    because it is important that you are connected with each other. This lasts until about 11am. <br>Then you go for a walk in the nearby village 
                    and of course have a late lunch around 2 o'clock with tasty sandwiches and freshly baked Finnish blueberry pie! <br>Then we go back to our special hotel, 
                    the igloos and you can fill in the rest of the day yourself.

                <p>The second day has arrived, and today we have a busy day! Today everyone can have breakfast until 10 o'clock
                    and then pack up well because after that we have a sleigh ride with huskies! At 12 o'clock we will stop and make a campfire to prepare and eat lunch.
                     After everyone has warmed up, we continue with the tour. The trip ends around 2am and we go back to the igloos and you have free time until 9pm, 
                     because then we go hunting for the Northern Lights! This lasts until 23:00.

                <p> The third day has already arrived, and for today there is not much planned. You will have a relaxed breakfast in the morning, until about 10 am. <br>
                    Then you go on a nice walk with a forester and enjoy nature! We also have lunch with a campfire somewhere in the woods. <br>
                    Then after lunch you have the choice to go for a walk or go back to the igloos to rest. Also today we will be hunting for the Northern Lights again at 21:00!

                <p>Unfortunately, is the last day. But that doesn't make it any less fun! Today we have until 10 am again to have breakfast. Today is a very simple day. 
                    You can choose what to do! You have the choice to go out with the huskies again, to take a walk in the forest or to explore the area. 
                    Each has a different start time so be careful with that. Of course you can also stay in your own igloo. And yes,
                    tonight we will hunt for the emergency light for the last time at 21:00!
