                    width="100%" height="200px">
                <p> On the first day you will drive and stay in Grand Teton National Park. You can enter the park
                    through three entrances
                    located on main roads. The northern entrance is on US-89 and leads to Yellow Stone National Park. To
                    the south of the
                    park, you enter the park from the town of Jackson via the US-89. The eastern entrance is located on
                    US-287 and enters
                    the park at Moran Junction. It is a beautiful landscape and perfect for hiking and wildlife sports.
                    It is beautifully
                    green and there are many animals like beavers, moose, bears etc. You can also visit places like:
                    Mormon row, Snake
                    River, Colter Bay Village, Jenny Lake, Cascade Canyon. When the evening comes, the sky is beautiful
                    and full of stars.
                    You can stay in a hotel, but we don't think that is a real freedom, so we advise you to stay at one
                    of the campsites. A
                    beautiful place you will enjoy very much!

                <p>
                    On the second day, you will unfortunately leave Grand Teton National Park. But luckily there is
                    another good park
                    waiting for you! Namely Zion National Park, you drive away from the park and head towards Zion
                    National Park. You will
                    see a beautiful gorge with a length of 24 kilometers and a depth of 800 meters. The flora and fauna
                    has been carved out
                    of the gorge by the Virgin River. Zion National Park is a real hiking park and especially suitable
                    for the more
                    practiced hiker. A number of hikes are quite tough and require good preparation and stamina. Take
                    plenty of water with
                    you on your hike and be prepared for changing weather conditions such as cold and strong winds. When
                    the night comes,
                    you can choose to stay at one of the three campsites. Lava Point Primitive Campground is a very
                    primitive campground,
                    you will not have access to water. And there are some other campgrounds just like the first one, a
                    beautiful park!

                <p>
                    After leaving Zion National Park, drive to the Gateway to the Kenai Fjords National Park (bring warm
                    clothes!). You will
                    be in the town of Seward, which is about 200 kilometers south of the city of Anchorage. You should
                    take about half a day
                    to cover the stretch and from Seward you can easily take the minibus to the Exit Glacier but the
                    rest of the park is
                    fairly inaccessible by road. So you will have to go on one of the boat tours that are offered in the
                    area, which is a
                    great trip. Once you arrive there, there is plenty to do: kayaking, hiking, puffin and wildlife
                    watching, so pick the
                    activities that appeal to you the most and make the most of it!

                <p>
                    After you have finished with Kenai Fjords National Park you will go to Yellowstone National Park,
                    the oldest national
                    park in the world! The park has a beautiful lake it is the largest mountain lake in America and
                    covers an area of 352
                    square kilometers. Yellowstone Lake is a good place for recreational anglers so bring your fishing
                    gear. You can hire
                    boats and canoes from Bridge Bay and Grant Village and take a boat trip around the lake. Apart from
                    that, there are
                    plenty of things to see, such as Mammoth Hot Springs, Upper Geyser Basin & Old Faithful, Grand
                    Prismatic Spring,
                    Yellowstone Lake, and the wildlife of course. Yellowstone National Park is known for its rich
                    wildlife. The park is home
                    to grizzly and brown bears, bison's, coyotes, deer's, elks and mountain goats, as well as many bird
                    species including
                    the eagle. In winter, you can follow the tracks of wolves in the snow. At the visitor centers you
                    can inquire about the
                    best times of day to spot wildlife. Caution is advised, as approaching bears is not permitted. It is
                    not possible to
                    spend the night here, so you will have to spend it in the van unless you want to drive straight on.

                <p>
                    And last but not least, Glacier National Park. Glacier National Park is located in the northwest of
                    Montana. 53 km
                    northeast of Kalispell you drive via State Highway 2 into the park via the West Entrance. State
                    Highway 89 enters the
                    park 51 km northwest of Browning at the Saint Mary Entrance. There are beautiful things to be seen
                    here as well, like:
                    Going-to-the-Sun Road, Logan Pass, Lake McDonald, Avalanche Lake, St. Mary Lake. There are also
                    beautiful geysers to see
                    and the weather is nice. In the north-eastern corner of Glacier National Park is Many Glacier, which
                    is considered the
                    heart of the park. Here you can go boating and horse riding (also with a guide), but above all it is
                    a paradise for
                    hikers. You can choose where to sleep there is a hostel where you can sleep, or the Belton Chalet
                    near Lake McDonald.
                    There are also plenty of campsites within the park boundaries, here you can use the Volkswagen van.
                    At Fish Creek and
                    St. Mary Campground you have the option to book in advance, at the other campgrounds it's first
                    come, first served. We
                    are sure you will enjoy these trips!
